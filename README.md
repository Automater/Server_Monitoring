### THIRD-PARTY REQUIREMENTS ###

1.  The server monitoring process rely on an external application called Automation Anywhere (http://http://www.automationanywhere.com).  The easiest way to install Automation Anywhere on a Windows computer is to download the software from http://http://www.automationanywhere.com/download/freeTrial.htm.

2.  Copy both script files into the folder: "My Documents\Automation Anywhere\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks".  For example: "C:\Users\Photoshop\Documents\Automation Anywhere Files\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks"

A)  Server Monitoring.atmx
 
B)  Server Monitoring.atmr

You will be able to see the saved script in the Automation Anywhere's task pane.  Now you can run the ACL script to call the script in Automation Anywhere to perform the server monitoring.

<blockquote>Automation Anywhere scripting is easy to learn and the learning curve of the person from programming background such as VB, C, C++, java, .Net, etc. will be much smaller and can trained faster.</blockquote>
